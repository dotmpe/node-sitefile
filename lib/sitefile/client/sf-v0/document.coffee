### document is a between class to test using optional & configurable mixins
for run-time components. Ie. to customize the UI components like no, one or
multiple search, or menus, etc.

DocumentPage is an attempt of this, using a set of mixins and a mix of a
bootstrap/docutils structured page DOM. The only problem wrt. dynamic run-time
UI components is that Component needs all its dependencies loaded, regardless
of wether they are configured.

  'cs!./component'
  'cs!./mixins'
  'lodash'
  'jquery'

], ( Component, mixins, _, $ ) ->


  class DocumentPage extends Component

    constructor: ( @container, @options ) ->
