Documentation Overview
======================
.. include:: .defaults.rst

Structure
----------
..

  TODO: replace README with one generic markdown variant.
  Move main rSt entry to index.rst

..

  TODO: documentation wise the following should also be
  mentioned:

  - Test setups with routers are included in examples_.
  - Source and comments are build for browser viewing with `Docco docs`_.

  Dev notes interspersed, vs. TODO_ document.
  Some integrate them here later.

  First, more use-cases in the feature docs.

  And ideally some kind of feedback from a BDD test setup.

  See also rSt 'Templates':

  - `feature doc form`_
  - `release doc form`_


Also seriously draft and getting stale, unreviewed and un-updated are:

`Getting Started Guide`_ and `First Extension Guide`_.
.. `Providing a Custom Metadata source`

For documentation wrt. to the project, see dev_.
